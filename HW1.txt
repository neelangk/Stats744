#Here, we can see that with the increase in height (which is directly proportional to age, in our case, 
#as our population consists of kids) the level of FEV increases. Ie, problems related to breathing is more as the kid grows.
 #The red line shown is produced by fitting a linear model, and the slope which is positive, indicates that there exist a
 #strong positive correlation between the height and fev. 





     

# Lets group the age in 3 categories....(children, adolscents and teenagers) and plot height against the fev..

#This is the box plot for the level of fev and smoking habit, between the two genders. 
#sex(0) indicates the two box plots related to girls in the study. First box plot refers to non smokers and it 
#shows almost symmetric and the second is for smokers which is negatively skewed. (here by smokers we refer to second-hand
# smokers).
#Sex(1) indicates the two box plots related to boys in the study. First box plot refers to non smokers which is 
#slightly positively skewed and the second is for smokers which is symmetric.

#This graph describes the relationship between the height and fev, here the age is grouped into three categories,
# 3-9 (children), 9-11 (adolescents) and 11-19 (teenagers). Here, we can see that the slope of age group (11-19)
# is more of vertical, which shows strong correlation than the other two categories, which is according to John Rauser,
# when he discusses comparison based on angles/slopes.
