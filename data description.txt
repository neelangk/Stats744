About the data:
This data set records are related to respiratory function and smoking for 654 children ages 3 to 19, who
were seen in the Childhood Respiratory Disease Study in 1980 in East Boston, Massachusetts. 
“Forced Expiratory Volume” (FEV) is the amount of air a person can exhale in the first second of a forceful breath, 
and indicates the person’s level of respiratory function. 
In particular, low FEV values are indicative of breathing problems and onset of asthma or possible respiratory dysfunction.
